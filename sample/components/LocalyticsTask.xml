 - LocalyticsTask
 -
 - This component is a wrapper around the Localytics library.
 - When localytics.brs is used from this component, the 'm' reference
 - becomes the local component 'm' and LocalyticsTask functions are
 - local component functions.
 -
 - The <interface> exposes a simple set of fields which map to the
 - event types.  The main SceneGraph UI thread will write data to
 - these fields in order to trigger the Task thread to send the
 - event on the network.
